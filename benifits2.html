        <h1> Scientific research confirms what Asians believed for centuries – that green and black tea contain
            powerful natural antioxidants which can protect regular tea drinkers from many degenerative diseases.

                <p>The main degenerative diseases of concern today are heart disease, high blood pressure stroke, cancer
                    and
                    diabetes. Studies have shown that the antioxidant activity of flavonoids in green and black tea
                    reduces
                    the
                    risk of many degenerative diseases and help maintain good oral health. </p>

                <p>Many research studies had been carried out to find whether tea components could improve the cognitive
                    function (all mental abilities and processes related to knowledge, which includes; attention,
                    memory,
                    judgment and evaluation, reasoning, problem solving and decision making, comprehension etc.). These
                    studies have found that tea components especially caffeine and theanine could improve the cognitive
                    function. Further, research studies have shown that tea components may have beneficial effects on
                    Alzheimer’s disease which is a prevalent disease of the elderly. However, from the studies carried
                    out
                    so far it is difficult to conclude whether tea consumption would actually improve the memory in old
                    age.

                <p>Long-term consumption of tea catechins could be beneficial against high-fat diet-induced obesity and
                    type
                    II diabetes and could reduce the risk of coronary disease. Further research that conforms to
                    international standards need to be performed to monitor the pharmacological and clinical effects of
                    green tea and to elucidate its mechanisms of action.</p>

        <p>Many in vitro studies have demonstrated the anti-oxidant properties of both black and green tea, as well as
            the antioxidant activity of the polyphenols in tea. Further studies have shown that these anti-oxidant
            components of tea are absorbed into the blood circulation from the digestive tract and act as anti-oxidants
            in body systems. These findings indicate that tea drinking helps to reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke
            and cancer, common degenerative diseases.</p>
